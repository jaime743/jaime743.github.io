Hi! Welcome to my Github Page.

My name is Jaime and I'm a Software Developer in a large company in Madrid.

I'm interested in modern development technologies and methodologies. I like Java, Javascript, Typescript, Python and many other languages. I'm particularly concerned about global warming. But there are lot of other things we can make better in the world.
